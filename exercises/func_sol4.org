** (a) /factorial/ function

  -- I will point one some interesting ones

** (b) /sumWhile/ function
   
#+begin_src haskell
  -- this function takes al the possible inits
  -- of my list (for example [1, 2] -> [[], [1], [1,2]])
  -- map sum over them and takes the last element found which is
  -- still less than max.
  -- works on infinite lists because takeWhile stops when sum >= max

  sumWhile max xs = last $ takeWhile (< max) (map sum (inits xs))
  
  -- sumListCond :: Int -> Int -> [Int] -> Int
  -- sumListCond l n xs | foldl (+) 0 (take l xs) <= n = sumListCond (l + 1) n xs
  --                    | otherwise = foldl (+) 0 (take (l - 1) xs)

  -- sumWhile2 n xs = sumListCond 0 n xs

* Exercise 3
#+begin_src haskell
  -- The complexity can be linear if the calculation of the next row of
  -- the triangle harnesses the result of the last calculated row.
