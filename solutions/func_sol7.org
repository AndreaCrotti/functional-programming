* Exercise 1
  For the definition of continuous functions
  $\bigsqcup f (s) = f(\bigsqcup s)$ and $\bigsqcup g (s) = g(\bigsqcup s)$
  We want to prove that also
  $g \cirg f : D1 \rightarrow D3$ is also continuous.

  We apply the definition of continuous function and get
  In other words we want to prove that:
  $\bigsqcup g (f (s)) = g (f (\bigsqcup s))$
  We use the following chain of equivalences:
  - $\bigsqcup g(f (s)) = g (\bigsqcup f (s))$  -- applying continuity of g
  - $g (\bigsqcup f (s)) = g (f (\bigsqcup s))$ -- applying continuity of f
    

* Exercise 2

** (a) \phi_{sum} is monotonic

** (b) \phi_{sum} is continuous

* Exercise 3

** (a) give the Haskell definitions for the higher order functions *f_four*, *f_inf* and *f_times*

** (b) give the semantics of \phi_{f_four} ...

** (c)

** (d)
