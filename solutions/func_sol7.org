* Exercise 1
  For the definition of continuous functions
  $\bigsqcup f (s) = f(\bigsqcup s)$ and $\bigsqcup g (s) = g(\bigsqcup s)$
  We want to prove that also
  $g \cirg f : D1 \rightarrow D3$ is also continuous.

  In other words we want to prove that:
  $\bigsqcup g (f (s)) = g (f (\bigsqcup s))$
  We use the following chain of equivalences:
  - $\bigsqcup g(f (s)) = g (\bigsqcup f (s))$  -- applying continuity of g
  - $g (\bigsqcup f (s)) = g (f (\bigsqcup s))$ -- applying continuity of f
    

* Exercise 2
  Let $S \sqsubseteq \langle Z \rightarrow Z \rangle$ be a chain of continuous functions $S = {g1, g2, g3, ...}$

** (a) \phi_{sum} is monotonic
   \phi_{sum} is monotonic then $g1 \sqsubseteq g2 \rightarrow \phi_{sum}(g1) \sqsubseteq \phi_{sum}(g2)$
   
*** Case 1: x is \bot
    $\phi_{sum}(g1))(\bot) = (\phi_{sum}(g2))(\bot) =$ \newline
    \begin{gathered}
    1 if x < 0 \\
    \bot otherwise \\
    \end{gathered}
    
    So, \phi_{sum} is as defined as \phi_{sum}(g2).

f\left( x \right) = \left\{ \begin{gathered}
  ax + b \hfill \\
  cx^2  + d \hfill \\
  ex^3  + fx + g \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}  \right.

*** Case 2: x \in Z
    $\lbrace{some stuff \\ more stuff}$


** (b) \phi_{sum} is continuous

* Exercise 3

** (a) give the Haskell definitions for the higher order functions *f_four*, *f_inf* and *f_times*
  

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell 
   f_four = \g -> \x -> 4

   f_inf  = \g -> \x -> g (x + 4)
   f_times = \g -> \(x, y) -> if x <= 0
                               then 0
                               else y + g(x - 1, y)
#+END_SRC


** (b) give the semantics of \phi_{f_four}
   - (\phi_{f_four}(g))(x) = 4
   - (\phi_{f_inf}(g))(x) = g(x + 4)
# TODO: Insert here the stupid big curly bracket
   - (\phi_{f_times}(g))(x, y) = 
   
** (c)
   - \phi^n{f_four}(\bot) = 4
   - \phi^n{f_inf}(\bot) = \bot
# TODO: curly bracket
   - \phi^n{f_times}(\bot) = 

** (d) Give all fixpoints of the semantic functions \phi_{f_four}, \phi_{f_inf}, and \phi_{f_times}. Which are /lub/?
